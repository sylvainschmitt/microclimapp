Air temperature at 1-m above the ground at every hour for the sensor "59-32-a"
in 2023 within plot "59-32" from the Mormal forest. Data are from the ANR
IMPRINT Project (2019-2023): temperature time series of each plot for the three
studied forests (Mormal, Blois and Aigoual). Two HOBO sensors were placed at the
center of each of 60 plots, to measure air temperature (1 m above the ground;
every hour), and soil temperature (8 cm below the ground; every two hours). This
dataset is a compilation of all soil and air temperatures measured by HOBO
sensors in each plot: (1) Mormal forest: the time series ranges from 2020-08-03
to 2023-10-23; (2) Blois forest: the time series ranges from 2020-07-11 to
2023-08-28; (3) Aigoual forest: the time series ranges from 2020-07-31 to
2023-09-17. Note that some plots may have holes (missing data) in the time
series.
