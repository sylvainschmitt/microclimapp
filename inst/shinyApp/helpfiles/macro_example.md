ERA5-Land temperature at 2ms have been extracted from the Google Earth Engine
(GEE) for longitude 3.70 and latitude 50.2 corresponding to the Mormal forest.
The ERA5-Land dataset is available for public use for the period from 1950 to 5
days before the current date. ERA5-Land provides hourly high resolution
information of surface variables. The data is a replay of the land component of
the ERA5 climate reanalysis with a finer spatial resolution: ~9km grid spacing.
ERA5-Land includes information about uncertainties for all variables at reduced
spatial and temporal resolutions.
